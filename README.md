# Project Introduction: 
The effectiveness and user-friendliness of ticketing systems are crucial components in determining the quality of the commuter experience in the modern world of public transportation. This ticketing system is mainly based on the bus system of Sri Lanka. This system helps the customer use new technologies like QR system to pay for bus tickets and it is also easy for the management team to deploy the system and manage it. A mobile application is given to the customer, bus inspectors, and drivers. The web application is given to the management board.
